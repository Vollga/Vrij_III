Project Vrij Planning/ToDo

- Repertoire research: 
	- What other games exist with randomly generated dungeons? roguelikes, dungeoncrawlers, isaac, diablo, etc
	- What algorithms are there? generate path and then generate rooms around path, design rooms and then assemble rooms, completely random?
	- What possible implementations for tilesets are there? aka how to the assets build levels from tiles, how do the tiles connect, etc
	- What features/limitations does each example algorithm have?

-> from that, make comparison table and reason why I chose a specific example to base my algorithm off
	- reason in regards to game idea
	- reason in regards to complexity
	- reason in regards to how i want to design the tileset

- Plan algorithm

- Design algorithm & what it needs (room layouts, tileset specifications, etc)

- Make algorithm & test with placeholders

- Concept Art

- Depending on time left: 1 or 2 tilesets, preferrably 2

- Design Tileset 1

- Make Tileset 1

- (Design Tileset 2)

- (Make Tileset 2)

- Implementation of Tilesets

- If 2 tilesets, implement toggle button to show off versatility & how well theyre implemented
